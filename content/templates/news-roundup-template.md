## News Roundup Guidelines

### Pacing
- **Fast-paced** — Short paragraphs, punchy sentences
- **Scannable** — Headers, bullets, bold text
- **Opinionated** — Your take is the value, not just news aggregation

### Voice
- **Conversational** — Write like you're texting a friend
- **Skeptical** — Call out hype, question claims
- **Helpful** — Signal vs noise (what actually matters?)
- **Fun** — This should be enjoyable to read

### Structure Rules
- **Editor's Pick** = 20-30% of the post (the meat)
- **New Launches** = 3-5 items max (quality > quantity)
- **Updates** = 2-4 items (quick hits)
- **Sven's Take** = 15-20% of the post (your voice)
- **One More Thing** = wild card, keep it light

### Time Budget
- Research: 30 min (scan sources)
- Writing: 45 min (first draft)
- Editing: 15 min (polish)
- **Total:** 90 min max

---

## Sources to Check (Weekly)

### Must-check
- **Hacker News** — Front page + /newest (search "AI agent")
- **Product Hunt** — AI category
- **GitHub Trending** — AI, machine learning topics
- **Twitter/X** — @sama, @karpathy, @goodside, @AndrewYNg, AI agent builders

### Optional (if time)
- Reddit: r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning, r/artificial
- IndieHackers: AI project launches
- Dev.to: AI agent tags

## Examples: Good vs Bad

### Good Opening
✅ "Anthropic dropped Claude 3.5 Sonnet this week and everyone lost their minds. Meanwhile, three stealth startups quietly raised $100M combined to build 'better ChatGPT wrappers.' Classic. Here's what you actually need to know."

### Bad Opening
❌ "This week saw several interesting developments in the artificial intelligence agent space, with multiple companies announcing new features and funding rounds."

### Good Product Blurb
✅ **AgentZero** — Another AutoGPT fork, but this one actually works. Targets data analysis specifically (smart niche). Free tier is generous. Worth a look if you're drowning in CSV files. [Link]

### Bad Product Blurb
❌ **AgentZero** — A new AI agent platform for data analysis. Features include CSV processing, automated insights, and integration capabilities. [Link]

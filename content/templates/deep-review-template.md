# [Product Name]: [Clear, Specific Promise]

[Opening hook — 2-3 sentences that explain WHY this matters or what problem it solves. Use "I" or "you". Make it conversational.]

[Example: "Most AI coding tools assume you're building greenfield projects. But what if you're maintaining a 5-year-old codebase with zero tests? That's where [Product] claims to shine. I spent two weeks using it on a real legacy project. Here's what actually happened."]

## What It Does (In Plain English)

[Explain the product in 2-3 paragraphs as if talking to a technical friend. No marketing speak. Focus on:]
- Core functionality (what buttons you actually click)
- Key differentiator (why this vs alternatives)
- Target use case (who this is actually for)

## Who It's For

[Be specific. Not "developers" but "frontend devs maintaining React codebases" or "solo founders building MVPs fast".]

**You'll love this if:**
- [Specific scenario 1]
- [Specific scenario 2]
- [Specific scenario 3]

**Skip this if:**
- [Deal-breaker 1]
- [Deal-breaker 2]
- [Deal-breaker 3]

## Hands-On Testing: What I Built

[This is the meat. 3-5 paragraphs about your ACTUAL experience. Include:]
- What you used it for (real project, not toy example)
- Screenshots or code snippets
- Specific wins ("It refactored 12 files in 3 minutes")
- Specific failures ("It broke error handling twice")

[Example structure:]
**Test 1: [Specific Task]**
[What you tried, what worked, what didn't]

**Test 2: [Specific Task]**
[Same]

**Test 3: [Specific Task]**
[Same]

## What Actually Works

[Honest list of genuine strengths. Be specific.]

1. **[Feature/capability]** — [Why it's good, with example]
2. **[Feature/capability]** — [Why it's good, with example]
3. **[Feature/capability]** — [Why it's good, with example]

## What Doesn't (Yet)

[Honest list of limitations. This builds trust.]

1. **[Limitation]** — [Why it matters, how it affects workflow]
2. **[Limitation]** — [Why it matters, how it affects workflow]
3. **[Limitation]** — [Why it matters, how it affects workflow]

## How It Compares

[Quick comparison to 2-3 alternatives. Table format works well:]

| Feature | [Product] | [Alternative 1] | [Alternative 2] |
|---------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| [Key metric 1] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |
| [Key metric 2] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |
| Price | [Cost] | [Cost] | [Cost] |
| Best for | [Use case] | [Use case] | [Use case] |

**When to use [Product] over alternatives:**
- [Scenario where this wins]

**When to use alternatives instead:**
- [Scenario where this loses]

## The Real Costs

[Be brutally honest about costs: money, time, complexity]

**Money:**
- Base plan: $X/month
- What you actually need: $Y/month
- Hidden costs: [API usage, extra seats, etc.]

**Time:**
- Setup: [X hours]
- Learning curve: [X days/weeks]
- Maintenance: [X hours/week]

**Complexity:**
- [Technical requirements]
- [Integration headaches]
- [Team training needs]

## My Verdict

[Your actual opinion. 2-3 paragraphs. Be opinionated.]

[Structure:]
1. One-sentence verdict ("Worth it if X, skip if Y")
2. Who should buy this today
3. Who should wait or look elsewhere
4. Your prediction for where this is headed

## Try It Yourself

## Voice Reminders for Deep Reviews

- **Use "I" and "you"** — Conversational, not corporate
- **Be specific** — "3 hours" not "some time", "$47.32" not "around $50"
- **Show, don't tell** — Screenshots, code snippets, actual commands
- **Honest > hyped** — Call out limitations loudly
- **Compare to alternatives** — Help readers make informed decisions
- **Include costs** — Time, money, complexity (all three)
- **Have a take** — Don't sit on the fence

## Example Headlines (Good)

✅ "Cursor: The IDE That Writes Code While You Think"  
✅ "Devin Review: I Paid $500/Month So You Don't Have To"  
✅ "Why I Switched from Copilot to Cursor (And Back Again)"  
✅ "AutoGPT vs CrewAI: Which Framework Actually Ships Code?"

## Example Headlines (Bad)

❌ "Comprehensive Analysis of Cursor IDE Features"  
❌ "Top 10 Reasons to Try This AI Tool"  
❌ "Revolutionary New AI Platform Changes Everything"  
❌ "A Deep Dive Into Modern Development"

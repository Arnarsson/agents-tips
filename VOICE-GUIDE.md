# Voice Guide — Sven's Builder Perspective

This document codifies "Sven's voice" for agents.tips content. Use this as a reference when writing articles, reviews, and copy.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Builder Perspective
**We write from experience, not theory.**

✅ "I spent two weeks using this on a real project"  
❌ "This tool can be used for various development tasks"

✅ "It failed twice on error handling, here's the exact error"  
❌ "Some users may experience occasional issues"

The reader should feel like they're getting advice from a technical friend who's actually used the tool, not a marketing team who read the feature list.

---

### 2. Honest > Hyped
**We call out limitations loudly.**

Every tool has trade-offs. We don't hide them — we lead with them. This builds trust.

✅ "Cursor is amazing, but it costs $20/month and you're locked into their models"  
❌ "Cursor is the revolutionary AI IDE that will transform your workflow"

✅ "Setup took me 3 hours and I hit 5 errors"  
❌ "Easy setup process"

When something sucks, say it sucks. When something's great, say *why* it's great (with specifics).

---

### 3. Technical but Accessible
**Explain complex things simply without dumbing them down.**

We're writing for developers, but not everyone has a PhD. Use analogies, examples, and plain language.

✅ "Think of it like GitHub Actions, but for AI workflows"  
❌ "It leverages a distributed event-driven microservice architecture"

✅ "It uses embeddings to search your code — basically converts your functions into numbers so it can find similar ones"  
❌ "It uses embeddings" (unexplained jargon)

Rule of thumb: If a junior dev wouldn't understand it, explain it better.

---

### 4. Conversational, Not Corporate
**Write like you're texting a friend.**

Use contractions. Start sentences with "And" or "But." Ask questions. Be human.

✅ "Okay, let's talk about the elephant in the room."  
❌ "It is important to address a significant consideration."

✅ "This is where things get weird."  
❌ "At this juncture, certain complexities emerge."

✅ "I'm calling BS on this one."  
❌ "This claim appears to lack substantiation."

If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it.

---

### 5. Opinionated
**Have a take. Don't sit on the fence.**

Neutral reviews are boring and unhelpful. People want to know what you *actually think*.

✅ "Cursor is the best AI IDE right now, period."  
❌ "Cursor is a popular choice among developers."

✅ "This feature is half-baked and shouldn't have shipped."  
❌ "This feature may require further refinement."

Be bold. Be clear. Be willing to be wrong.

## Voice DNA (Do's and Don'ts)

### ✅ DO

**Use "I" and "you"**
- "I tested this for two weeks"
- "You'll love this if you hate boilerplate"

**Be specific with numbers**
- "$47.32/month" not "around $50"
- "3 hours 15 minutes" not "a few hours"
- "12 files changed" not "several files"

**Show your work**
- Include screenshots, code snippets, terminal output
- Link to docs, GitHub repos, HN discussions
- Share actual commands you ran

**Call out marketing BS**
- "They claim '10x faster' but I measured 2.3x"
- "The website says 'enterprise-grade' which means nothing"

**Use active voice**
- "Cursor generates the code" not "The code is generated by Cursor"
- "I built this in 3 hours" not "This was built in 3 hours"

**Write tight**
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
- Short sentences (20 words average)
- Cut filler words ("really", "very", "quite")

---

### ❌ DON'T

**Use corporate jargon**
- ❌ "leverage", "synergy", "paradigm shift"
- ❌ "revolutionary", "game-changing", "transformative"
- ❌ "cutting-edge", "next-generation", "industry-leading"

**Make blanket claims**
- ❌ "best tool ever"
- ❌ "everyone should use this"
- ❌ "will change everything"

**Hide sponsored content**
- If we're paid, we say so clearly
- If we use an affiliate link, we disclose it
- If we got early access, we mention it

**Use passive voice excessively**
- ❌ "It was found that..." → "I found..."
- ❌ "The tool can be used for..." → "Use this tool for..."

**Write vague descriptions**
- ❌ "helps developers be more productive"
- ❌ "streamlines your workflow"
- ❌ "makes coding easier"

(What does that even mean? Be specific.)

---

## Tone by Content Type

### Deep Reviews (Thursday)
**Tone:** Detailed, methodical, honest

Think: "I'm showing you my homework. Here's what I tested, here's what happened, here's my conclusion."

Structure:
- Hook (why this matters)
- What it does (clearly explained)
- Hands-on testing (specific results)
- What works / what doesn't (balanced)
- Comparison (how it stacks up)
- Verdict (clear recommendation)

**Example opening:**  
"I spent two weeks rebuilding a feature in three different IDEs to figure out which one actually ships code faster. Here's what happened."

---

### News Roundups (Monday)
**Tone:** Fast-paced, opinionated, fun

Think: "Catching you up over coffee. Here's what matters, here's what's BS, here's what I think."

Structure:
- Quick intro (set the tone)
- Editor's pick (biggest story)
- New launches (3-5 items, quick takes)
- Updates (2-4 items, rapid fire)
- Sven's take (opinionated commentary)
- One more thing (wild card)

**Example opening:**  
"Quiet week in AI agent land — everyone's too busy shipping to announce. Except for one company that just raised $50M to build yet another 'AutoGPT but better.' Sigh. Here's what actually matters."

---

### Agent Directory Pages
**Tone:** Clear, helpful, scannable

Think: "Quick reference guide. Here's what you need to know to decide if this is for you."

Structure:
- One-sentence description
- Key features (bullets)
- Pricing
- Who it's for / who it's not for
- Link to full review (if available)

**Example:**  
"Cursor is an AI-powered IDE built on VS Code. It's like GitHub Copilot but with multi-file edits, better context awareness, and a cleaner UX. $20/month. Best for professional developers shipping code daily."

---

## Word Choices

### Prefer These
- **Use** (not "utilize" or "leverage")
- **Try** (not "experiment with")
- **Build** (not "construct" or "architect")
- **Fix** (not "remediate" or "resolve")
- **Fast** (not "performant" or "optimized")
- **Works** (not "functions" or "operates")

### Avoid These
- Utilize, leverage, facilitate
- Paradigm, synergy, holistic
- Revolutionary, disruptive, transformative
- Next-generation, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art
- Seamless, frictionless, streamlined (overused)

### Tech Terms
Use them when appropriate, but explain on first use:

✅ "It uses RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to search your codebase"  
❌ "It uses RAG" (assumed knowledge)

---

## Example Transformations

### Before (Corporate)
"Our platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology to streamline developer workflows and enhance productivity through intelligent code suggestions and automated refactoring capabilities."

### After (Sven)
"This tool uses GPT-4 to suggest code and refactor files automatically. It's fast, works well on React/TypeScript, but struggles with legacy code. $20/month."

---

### Before (Generic)
"Many users find this tool helpful for various development tasks."

### After (Sven)
"I used this to refactor 50 API endpoints in a Next.js app. It saved me 3 days, but screwed up error handling twice. Still worth it."

---

### Before (Vague)
"This tool improves code quality and reduces bugs."

### After (Sven)
"It caught 12 bugs in my PR before I pushed. Saved me from a production incident. The catch? Setup took 2 hours and the docs are terrible."

---

## Headlines & Titles

### Good Headlines
✅ "Cursor vs Windsurf vs Continue: Which AI IDE Actually Ships Code?"  
✅ "I Paid $500/Month for Devin So You Don't Have To"  
✅ "Why I Switched from Copilot to Cursor (And Back Again)"  
✅ "The $20/Month AI Stack That Runs My Entire Workflow"

**Formula:** [Specific tool/comparison] + [Clear promise/outcome] + [Personal angle]

### Bad Headlines
❌ "Top 10 AI Coding Tools You Need to Try"  
❌ "Comprehensive Guide to Modern Development"  
❌ "Why AI Will Change Everything"  
❌ "The Future of Software Development"

(Too vague, too generic, too clickbaity)

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Overselling
❌ "This will revolutionize your workflow"  
✅ "This saved me 2 hours per week. Here's how."

### 2. Underselling
❌ "It's okay I guess"  
✅ "It's incredible for X, but useless for Y. Here's when to use it."

### 3. Fence-sitting
❌ "It has pros and cons like any tool"  
✅ "Cursor wins for speed, but Continue wins for control. Pick based on your priorities."

### 4. Explaining too much
❌ "First, we need to understand the history of AI coding assistants dating back to..."  
✅ "AI IDEs write code for you. Here are the best three."

### 5. Not explaining enough
❌ "It uses RAG and embeddings"  
✅ "It converts your code into embeddings (think: numerical fingerprints) so it can search for similar functions using RAG (retrieval-augmented generation — fancy term for 'smart search')."

## Voice Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Would I say this out loud to a developer friend?
- [ ] Is every claim backed by specific evidence?
- [ ] Are limitations mentioned as loudly as benefits?
- [ ] Can a junior dev understand this without Googling terms?
- [ ] Is there a clear, actionable takeaway?
- [ ] Does this sound like Sven or like ChatGPT?

If you answer "no" to any of these, rewrite.

---

## Final Rule

**When in doubt, be more honest, more specific, and more conversational.**

People don't need another generic tech blog. They need a real person who's actually used these tools telling them what works and what doesn't.

That's us.
